# IOT Operational Considerations for connecting STUB networksfor BRSKI Registrar

IETF currently provides protocols for automatically connecting single hosts to existing network infrastructure.
This document describes a related problem: the problem of connecting a stub network (a collection of hosts behind a router) automatically to existing network infrastructure in the  same manner.

The solution described here is particularly applicatble to unmanaged residential networks, for stub networks consisting of IoT sensors and actuators, but the solution described has general applicability.
